# Quick-Pass

Quck-Pass is a Python script that generates a strong  
password that can be used for just about anything.  


## The importance of a strong password
Im sure you've seen the occasional article or news report,  
where it's found that employees of "X" company or "Y" Corp  
had their security practices audited.  

Janice in accounting used ***"password"*** as her password.
John, well he's a clever boy. He stepped it up a notch: ***"Password123"***.  
I did say he was clever.  
And then there's Bill,  
because there's always a Bill.  

Bill's password is ***"Nr?r7]04Z\"***.  
Wow Bill, that sounds like a decently strong password!  
Good Job Pal.  

Bill gets a promotion and that new corner office hes been eyeing,  

while John and Janice have to attend the super important mandatory  
meeting on why hiding your password under your family guy mouse pad,  
(Who still uses mouse pads) is a bad idea.  
We should all strive to be more like Bill.  
Bill 

It sucks trying to think of a new password, especially on the fly.  
Quick-Pass takes care of that ickyness for you.
